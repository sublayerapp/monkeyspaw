# Components in MonkeysPaw

## Page Content

Create a detailed explanation page about the component system in MonkeysPaw, focusing on how layout and style components work together with page content to create cohesive web experiences.

### Introduction Section
- Heading: "The Building Blocks of Wishes"
- Overview: "Components in MonkeysPaw provide the foundation and character for your wishes. While your page descriptions define what content appears, components determine how that content is structured and presented. Understanding components is key to crafting effective wishes."

### Component Types Overview
- Explain the two primary component types:
  1. **Layout Components**: Define the structural organization and arrangement of content
  2. **Style Components**: Define the visual presentation, aesthetics, and mood

### Layout Components Section
- Heading: "Layout Components: The Skeleton"
- Explanation: "Layout components determine how your content is arranged on the page, establishing the structural foundation for your wishes."

- Key aspects to cover:
  - How layout components define page structure
  - The relationship between layout and responsiveness
  - How layout influences user experience
  - Typical elements defined in layout components

- Sample Layout Component:
```markdown
# Layout Component

Create a layout with:
- Fixed navigation header with logo and menu
- Hero section with large image and overlay text
- Three-column feature section for desktop, single column for mobile
- Testimonial section with carousel
- Contact form in a centered card
- Footer with three sections: company info, links, and social media
```

- Annotation explaining each part of the sample
- Visual diagram showing how a layout component maps to the final page structure

### Style Components Section
- Heading: "Style Components: The Skin"
- Explanation: "Style components define the visual language of your site, determining colors, typography, visual effects, and the overall mood of your pages."

- Key aspects to cover:
  - How style components establish visual identity
  - The relationship between style and brand perception
  - How style choices influence user engagement
  - Typical elements defined in style components

- Sample Style Component:
```markdown
# Style Component

Apply these styling guidelines:
- Color palette: Deep blue (#1E3A8A) for primary elements, coral (#FF6B6B) for accents, and light gray (#F3F4F6) for backgrounds
- Typography: Playfair Display for headings, Raleway for body text
- Buttons should have rounded corners with subtle hover effects
- Cards should have soft shadows and slight border radius
- Use subtle animations for interactive elements
- Images should have a slight zoom effect on hover
```

- Annotation explaining each part of the sample
- Visual examples showing how different style components can dramatically change the same layout

### Component Interaction Section
- Heading: "The Dance of Components"
- Explanation of how layout and style components work together with page content
- Visual showing the same content with:
  1. Different layouts but same style
  2. Same layout but different styles
  3. How both combine to create completely different experiences

### Creating Effective Components
- Best practices for writing layout components:
  - Focus on structure, not specific content
  - Consider responsive behavior
  - Define clear content areas
  - Maintain consistency across pages

- Best practices for writing style components:
  - Create cohesive color schemes
  - Establish consistent typography rules
  - Define interactive behavior
  - Consider accessibility needs

### Advanced Component Techniques
- Heading: "Mastering Component Craft"
- Tips for advanced usage:
  - Creating themed variants of components
  - Developing component systems for different page types
  - Using conditional elements in components
  - Creating component libraries for reuse

### Common Pitfalls Section
- Discuss typical mistakes and how to avoid them:
  - Overloading components with too much detail
  - Mixing content concerns with layout/style
  - Conflicting instructions between components
  - Ignoring mobile/responsive considerations

### Component Examples Gallery
- Show 3-4 pairs of layout+style components and the resulting pages
- Include annotations explaining how specific component instructions manifested in the final design
