# MonkeysPaw Best Practices

## Page Content

Create a comprehensive guide to writing effective wishes (prompts) in MonkeysPaw. The page should help users avoid common pitfalls and learn techniques for getting the most precise and useful results from their wishes.

### Introduction
- Heading: "The Art of Careful Wishing"
- Overview: "The monkey's paw grants exactly what you ask forâ€”not what you intend. Mastering the art of wish-crafting is essential to harnessing the full power of this framework without unexpected consequences. This guide will help you develop prompts that produce precisely what you desire."

### The Golden Rules Section
- Present 5 fundamental principles of effective wish-crafting:
  1. **Be Specific**: Clearly describe what you want, leaving minimal room for interpretation
  2. **Be Structured**: Organize your wishes into logical sections with clear hierarchy
  3. **Be Contextual**: Provide relevant context for the AI to understand your intentions
  4. **Be Consistent**: Avoid contradictory or conflicting instructions
  5. **Be Reasonable**: Make wishes within the realistic capabilities of the system

### Anatomy of an Effective Wish
- Break down the structure of a well-crafted wish:
  - Clear title and purpose statement
  - Content sections with hierarchical organization
  - Specific details about functionality and appearance
  - Examples where helpful
  - Tone and style guidance

### Before and After Examples
- Show 3-4 examples of poorly written wishes alongside improved versions:

**Example 1: Vague vs. Specific**
- Before:
```markdown
# Contact Page
Make a contact page with a form and some information.
```

- After:
```markdown
# Contact Page

## Purpose
Create a contact page that makes it easy for potential clients to reach out while providing enough information to qualify leads.

## Required Elements
- Heading: "Get in Touch" with a brief welcome message
- Contact form with fields for:
  - Name (required)
  - Email (required, with validation)
  - Phone (optional)
  - Company (optional)
  - Message (required, with 500 character minimum)
  - Reason for contact (dropdown: General Inquiry, Project Quote, Support, Partnership)
- Company information sidebar with:
  - Physical address with map
  - Phone number and email
  - Business hours
  - Response time expectation (24-48 hours)
- FAQ section with 3-4 common questions about the contact process

## Visual Style
- Clean and professional
- Form should stand out visually from the page
- Use icons for contact methods
- Include subtle visual cues for required fields
```

- Annotations pointing out specific improvements

**Example 2: Disorganized vs. Structured**
- Before/After examples showing how organization improves results

**Example 3: Contradictory vs. Consistent**
- Before/After examples showing how resolving contradictions improves outcomes

**Example 4: Ambiguous vs. Clear**
- Before/After examples showing how clarity reduces misinterpretation

### Common Pitfalls Section
- List and explain frequent mistakes:
  - **Ambiguity**: Using terms with multiple interpretations
  - **Over-specification**: Providing too much detail that conflicts or overcomplicates
  - **Under-specification**: Not providing enough guidance in critical areas
  - **Mixed concerns**: Confusing content, layout, and style instructions
  - **Assumed knowledge**: Failing to provide necessary context
  - **Impossible combinations**: Requesting mutually exclusive features
  - **Forgetting mobile**: Not considering responsive design needs
  - **Inconsistent terminology**: Using different terms for the same concept

- For each pitfall, include:
  - A brief explanation of the problem
  - A concrete example of the issue
  - A solution approach

### Advanced Techniques Section
- Share sophisticated wish-crafting strategies:

1. **Progressive Disclosure Technique**
   - Start with a clear overview
   - Break down each section into components
   - Provide details in a hierarchical manner
   - Example of this technique in action

2. **Visual Language Mastery**
   - Using descriptive terms effectively
   - Creating clear visual hierarchy
   - Communicating design intent without visual examples
   - Vocabulary for common visual patterns

3. **User Journey Mapping**
   - Describing interactions from the user's perspective
   - Defining clear user flows and expectations
   - Anticipating edge cases and scenarios
   - Building narrative-driven experiences

4. **Component Thinking**
   - Creating modular, reusable wish patterns
   - Establishing consistent naming conventions
   - Developing a wish component library
   - Combining components effectively

### Testing Your Wishes
- Guidance on evaluating results:
  - Review objective: Did you get all requested elements?
  - Review subjective: Does it feel right?
  - Identify specific areas for refinement
  - Iterative improvement strategies
  - A/B testing different wish formulations

### Specialized Wish Types
- Advice for specific page types:
  1. **Landing Pages**: Focus on conversion paths and clear CTAs
  2. **Product Pages**: Balance information and purchasing guidance
  3. **Content Sites**: Emphasize readability and content discovery
  4. **Applications**: Prioritize usability and interaction design
  5. **Documentation**: Structure information for both scanning and deep reading

### Collaboration Strategies
- Tips for team-based wish development:
  - Creating wish templates and standards
  - Review processes before submission
  - Documentation of effective patterns
  - Sharing learnings across the team

### When Things Go Wrong
- Troubleshooting guidance:
  - Identifying where interpretation diverged from intention
  - Specific strategies for correcting common issues
  - When to rewrite vs. when to refine
  - Breaking complex wishes into simpler components
