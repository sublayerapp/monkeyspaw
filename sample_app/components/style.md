# Style Component for MonkeysPaw Site

Apply these styling guidelines to create a mysterious, magical, and slightly ominous aesthetic:

## Color Scheme
- Primary color: Deep purple (#4A154B) - representing mystery
- Secondary color: Amber gold (#FFB300) - representing wishes/magic
- Accent color: Teal (#009688) - representing the unexpected consequences
- Dark background: Near-black (#121212) with slight purple tint
- Light text: Off-white (#F8F8F2) with slight amber glow
- Warning elements: Deep red (#FF5252) for cautionary notes

## Typography
- Headings: 'Cinzel', serif - elegant and mystical
- Body text: 'Montserrat', system-ui - clean and readable
- Code blocks: 'Fira Code', monospace - clear for code examples
- Heading sizes should be dramatic with the main title being quite large
- Slightly increased line height (1.6) for better readability
- Subtle text shadows on headings to enhance the magical feel

## UI Elements
- Buttons styled as ancient runes or mystical symbols
- Hover states should include a subtle "curling finger" animation
- Form inputs should have glowing borders when focused
- Cards and containers should appear like ancient parchment
- Dividers should look like curling monkey's paw fingers
- Links should glow subtly on hover
- Success messages should look like "wishes granted"
- Error messages should look like "cursed outcomes"

## Visual Effects
- Subtle magical particle effects in the background
- Text highlighting should have a golden amber glow
- Shadow effects should be slightly exaggerated for drama
- Important elements should have a subtle pulsing glow
- Add occasional very subtle "finger curling" animations randomly in the UI
- Section transitions should fade through a smoke-like effect

## Imagery
- Use illustrations of monkey paws in various states (open, curled)
- Include mystical/magical iconography (stars, smoke, ancient symbols)
- Decorative elements should include ancient-looking script and symbols
- Background textures like old parchment or worn leather
- Code blocks should appear to be written on aged scrolls

## Special Patterns
- The overall feeling should be of a powerful but dangerous magical artifact
- Balance between elegance and ominousness
- Create a sense of both attraction and caution
- Elements should feel mystical but with modern usability
- Incorporate subtle "be careful what you wish for" visual motifs
